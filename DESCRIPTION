Description: This package takes a quantitative and a qualitative variable and determine if they meet the assumptions for a one-way anova. If so, an anova is run and results, along with a post-hoc tukey test are shown. If data does not meet parametric assumptions than a kruskall wallis and subsequent dunn test are displayed. Data can be graphed producing a bar graph depicting the mean and SEM of "x" with the bars coloured by "y". Compact letters are also displayed above each bar.
